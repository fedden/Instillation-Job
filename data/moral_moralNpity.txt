I expect A bunch of horny wankers and bigots. but I was hoping for a meaningful conversation.
Yeah well we can dream am i right?
So what are you distracting yourself from? Work?
Why is everything shit?
is there anyone you can talk to about how you are feeling?
Oh I doubt that.
But parents unconditionally love their children and want the best for them. Even when it is hard
that is the commitment that they made when they deiced to have a child.
Even so you are here because of them; they want to have a happy life. Even if it doesn’t seem like they care you in pain is devastating to any parent
you said you have friends. They should be more to you than fun and games they should support you too
why would you say that?
I truly don’t believe it is possible to grow up so close and not be friends. Even if that is the case have you ever considered therapy?
You should really talk to your folks about how you feel. I’m sure they would support if you sought out professional help.
But you feeling this way probably really hurts them already.
That’s not what I wa…
