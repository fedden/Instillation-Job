-.- *sigh*
Why does everyone this site have to be such a wanker.
Lol that’s cute. But doesn’t it you feel sick at societies obsession with sex. 
I mean, it’s degrading our species integrity. It causes so much body confident issues in both genders, warps people’s perception on what relationships are and has put females at risk.
It’s like men are taught that sex is the most important part of life and therefore with out it they are not men.
So here comes the fucked up part. 
Because of the fucked up gender roles that are shoved down our throats these men feel the need to compensate with another form of so-called man hood. Violence.
Me too lol. 
so… what are you up to?
right, so any chance of a serious conversation happening here?
I mean about anything real?
