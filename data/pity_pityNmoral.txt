A distraction
Good luck with that on here.
Lol I guess
Not really.
though I should be doing some revision
But I can’t focus, everything is shit so I’m here to help distract myself from that I guess.
It’s just I feel empty, I don’t want to sleep or eat or anything
No, my friends would not understand and my parents are sick of me
No I bring them nothing but pain and misery.
Well they never decided to have me so I guess that doesn’t apply.
I’m not in pain, I just feel empty.
I don’t really think that they are my friends
like I’m coming to the end of my school life and like I’ve been with the same set of people since kindergarten. We live in a small town so we are friends out of convenience. I don’t really think that they care for me at all. 
I have but the clinic is in the city. It takes 2 hours to get to on the bus. So my parents would know if I was gone for so long. They can’t know.
I know they would but it would break their hearts.
Don’t you think I fucking know that? I know they I’m selfish for feeling this way and inflicting it on the people that care about it. There is no reason nothing has fucking happened for me to feel this so no one understands me and it hurts them
