Because I can't sleep
No, I’m just trying to distract myself from everything
Just stuff
It’s ok I mean, I have not been able to sleep properly for days I look like a zombie
Doesn’t help, psychological exhaustion is what does me in, not physical, I can work all day and still not sleep
Technically yes but they suck worse than the sleep deprivation Feels like a fucking tranq dart to the nuts
I can’t I have Asthma.
Couldn’t I hate the smell. Also, considering alcohol doesnt work, I doubt weed would. The amount I need to drink to calm down is about the same amount that makes me feel really sick. Also is expensive.
