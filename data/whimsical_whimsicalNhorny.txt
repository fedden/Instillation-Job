I guess I should get back to work also.
Is there a wrong answer to that question???
I get the feeling you are telling me porkie pies >>
It means that you are lying to me. This would make me a very sad panda if you lied to me.
Well I’m 14 and live in the Rivendell 
Does it matter?
But would you say anything to someone who’s in-between?
No 
will you disconnect if I say the wrong one?
Promise?
So you will keep talking to me no matter what?
For real?
If you are lying Santa will be pissed
Ok I’ll tell you.
