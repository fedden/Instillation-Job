I guess it was a little hard ^^
I’m not a wanker. I’m a unicorn! :3
Well I do feel a little queasy.
but I think that has more to do with the bad burrito I just ate :S
do females like burritos too? Is that why they are at risk?
I prefer spring rolls to gender.
This silly
that and looking for the chair police
My chair was stolen
the culprit must pay!
I’m deadly serious 
this is very real. ╰༼ •̀۝•́ ༽╯
I believe my cat is to blame
he always seems gui..
